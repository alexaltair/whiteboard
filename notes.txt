X has_many Y

X has_many Y :through Z

  Does it put a y_id on the z table if you don't type "Y has_many X :through Z"?
X has_one Y :through Z
  puts an x_id in the z table and a z_id on the y table
  What happens if you don't type "Z has_one Y"?
X has_and_belongs_to_many Y
  Makes a XsYs table, whose rows are pairs of x_ids and y_ids.
  What happens if you don't write "has_and_belong_to_many" in both places?
X has_many Y, as: Z
  puts a x_id in the y table as a z_id, and a z_type which is x
self joins

belongs_to vs has_one
has_many :through vs has_and_belongs_to_many
  Do you want the relationship to be a thing of its own, with attributes, validations, and callbacks?
